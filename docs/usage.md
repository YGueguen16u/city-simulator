**plan**
- social class impede certain spends
- put a saver type --> give an average and an std of spends for a person
- Types of spends = f(age, social_class, gender, location, religion, weight, height )
- Types of spends ==> simulation of the economy
- Black box = outside the city --> incoming flows and outgoing flows
- city --> class mutable 
  - interaction of people ==> new things : new companies

--> simulation every year then every week ... ms



- In a further way, define people with more specific data 
  - disease
  - body data so that having information about the metabolism of people 
  - That could specify other values as spends ... 

## First step

- a retiree 
  - earn â‚¬ 1500 every month by the state (flue from a black box )
