**coordinates system**

Geographic coordinates are traditionally expressed in the sexagesimal system, sometimes noted as "DMS": degrees (°), minutes (′), and seconds (″). 

The basic unit is the degree of angle (1 full circle = 360°), then the minute of angle (1° = 60′), and finally the second of angle (1° = 3,600″).

To provide an approximate comparison of these units in terms of distance on the Earth's surface, the circumference of the Earth, which corresponds to 360°, is exactly 40,007.864 km along a double meridian. It is precisely 40,075.017 km at the equator; therefore:

- One degree represents approximately 111.319 km (at the equator);
- One minute represents approximately 1.855 km (at the equator);
- One second represents approximately 30.92 m (at the equator).

Measurements smaller than a second are noted using the decimal system.

These distances, corresponding to a difference in longitude (in degrees, minutes, or seconds), vary according to the latitude of the location since the Earth's meridians gradually converge from the equator toward the poles. The table below provides some illustrative examples.

Lengths of Longitude Differences at Different Latitudes

| Latitude       | City             | One Degree ≈ | One Minute ≈ | One Second ≈ | ±0.0001° ≈ |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 60° 10′ 32″ N  | Helsinki         | 55.50 km     | 0.925 km     | 15.40 m      | 5.50 m     |
| 51° 28′ 38″ N  | Greenwich        | 69.47 km     | 1.158 km     | 19.30 m      | 6.95 m     |
| 44° 50′ 16″ N  | Bordeaux         | 78.85 km     | 1.31 km      | 21.90 m      | 7.89 m     |
| 29° 58′ 00" N  | New Orleans      | 96.49 km     | 1.61 km      | 26.80 m      | 9.65 m     |
| 0° 14′ 18″ S   | Quito            | 111.3 km     | 1.855 km     | 30.92 m      | 11.13 m    |

Latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the line extending from the center of the Earth to a certain point on its surface. It references the north-south position on the Earth. It's represented by circles of latitude, or parallels - the lines that go around the globe. The central line of latitude is called the Equator. It has a latitude of 0 degrees. The maximum value of latitude is 90 degrees - found at the poles.

Longitude, on the other hand, refers to an east-west position on the Earth. Lines of longitude, or meridians, connect the North and the South Pole. They extend to the east and west of the Prime Meridian, reaching up to 180 degrees. All meridians have the same length - 12,429.9 miles (20,003.93 km).


**plan**
- social class impede certain spends
- put a saver type --> give an average and an std of spends for a person
- Types of spends = f(age, social_class, gender, location, religion, weight, height )
- Types of spends ==> simulation of the economy
- Black box = outside the city --> incoming flows and outgoing flows
- city --> class mutable 
  - interaction of people ==> new things : new companies

--> simulation every year then every week ... ms



- In a further way, define people with more specific data 
  - disease
  - body data so that having information about the metabolism of people 
  - That could specify other values as spends ... 

## First step

- a retiree 
  - earn € 1500 every month by the state (flue from a black box )

## Create shop
- create shop and the associated jobs

## Create buildings and schools
- place family in buildings 
- create schools and associated jobs
